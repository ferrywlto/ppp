Why CMS/Website over FB Page?
- Data ownership
- Customized branding options
- Platform lock-in
- Policy change by FB
- You agree all your content on FB can be use and sell by FB or other FB users
- You have no control on negative comment.
- Get money/Reach user directly
- Business presence can be search by Google.
- Should have both channels simultaneously.
